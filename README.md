# Unclosed Anchor Tag Bug in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common HTML bug: an unclosed anchor tag.  This can lead to unexpected rendering issues and affect accessibility.

The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous code. `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe that the text after the link is also treated as a part of the link.

## Solution

The problem lies in the missing closing `&lt;/a&gt;` tag.  The corrected `bugSolution.html` file shows the proper way to close the anchor tag.
